# NYC Airbnb 2019 Data Visualization

This project explores the Airbnb rental market in New York City using 2019 open data. The analysis covers rental type popularity, borough-specific insights, host behaviors, and comparisons between Airbnb and hotel rates.

## Skills & Tools
- Tableau
- Data Visualization
- Geographic mapping
- Custom calculations and parameters

## Project Overview

**Key Questions:**
- Which type of Airbnb rental is most popular?
- Which borough has the highest number of entire space listings?
- How many reviews per month does each borough have?
- How many listings do typical hosts own in Manhattan?
- How does the price of Airbnb rentals compare to 1-star and 2-star hotels?

**Data:**  
- Source: [NYC Airbnb Open Data 2019 (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data/data)
- No major cleaning was required.

**Techniques Used:**
- Heat Maps
- Geographic Maps
- Hierarchies (boroughs > neighborhoods)
- Personalized Calculations (e.g., average rates, listings per host, review frequency)
- Specialized Tools: Highlight, Group, Reference Lines, Computed Sort

## How to View
- A summary of key insights is available in the accompanying presentation slides (`Final_Presentation_ThuyNguyen.pptx`).
- To further explore the interactive dashboards, please **download** the Tableau packaged workbook (`MGT586_final_project.twbx`) and **open it using Tableau Desktop** or **Tableau Public Desktop Edition**.
- (Note: The workbook cannot be viewed directly online without Tableau installed.)
  
## Sample Insights
- Entire space rentals dominate Manhattan listings.
- Manhattan hosts with more than 3 listings typically offer private apartments.
- Average Airbnb rates are competitive compared to 1-star hotels.

## Motivation
I love to travel and often struggle deciding between hotels and Airbnb stays. This project helped me understand the NYC rental landscape and practice advanced visualization techniques.
